            <pb style="margin-bottom:2%; margin-top:5%;"><ii/>Dissociative Identity Disorder, also known as DID. A mental disorder that is said to allow the existence of at least two personalities to inhabit the same vessel.<br/><Br/><ii/><i>I am Toone,</i> at least, that's who I am right now. I am one of many who suffer from this disorder, the illness itself doesn't really affect my happy life that much. Yet, it is still something that seems to always put me on edge. I often ask myself, is the other <pg2>me</pg2> aware of our coexistence?<br/><br/><ii/>My friends and family have always noticed that sometimes I seem to be smarter and more thoughtful every now and then. Of course, back then I just took those as compliments like the humble fellow that I am. It was only until that day when I had my mental health checked by a psychiatrist, I found out about DID. This revelation practically changed me as a person. Who is this <pg2>person</pg2>? I've always had trouble differentiating my dreams and my memories, perhaps <pg2>his</pg2> existence is the reason why. Is <pg2>he</pg2></pg2> a bad person? A good person? I don't know. I don't know anything about <pg2>him</pg2>.<br/><br/><ii/>I've always wanted to know more about the enigma that is <pg2>me</pg2>, but I haven't found a way to do this yet. No, I have found a way. It is that I've never had the courage to ask. I've always been afraid of an answer. I've always been afraid of <i>the answer.</i> I've always been afraid of <pg2>him</pg2>, for all the selfish reasons. Am I really the original? Am I the one meant to be alive? Did I steal <pg2>his</pg2> body? I was never the brightest, honestly, it wouldn't be much of a stretch to say I am a scum of the Earth. If what people say about <pg2>me</pg2> is true, doesn't that mean I am just a defective version?<br/><br/><ii/>The question of whether <pg2>he</pg2> knows about me appears so simple yet it implies very much to me. It seems extremely illogical to me that <pg2>he</pg2> never leaves any trail of his behaviors or existence. Sure, there are a few "clues" from time to time but I only realized it after the fact that I was made aware of my disorder. This is more of an outside intervention than anything, it's as if me knowing about DID was never part of the plan. Is <pg2>he</pg2> intentionally hiding himself from me? Is he the Messiah who simply wishes for me to enjoy my life to its fullest? Or is he the Devil who uses my existence as a facade for his endeavors?<br/><br/><ii/>Whatever the truth may be, this question has haunted me for years—and now, I can bear it no longer. Today, I've decided to face my other half. I've decided to face <pg2>him</pg2>.<br/><br/><center>I've decided to face <pg2>myself</pg2>.</center></pb>

        <pb style="margin-bottom:2%; margin-top:5%"><ii/>I pulled my phone out, trembling at the mere thought of sending <pg2>him</pg2> a message.<br/><ii/>"Sigh... You can do it Toone."</br><ii/>With that sentence of encouragement I had given to myself, I opened the popular messaging app called "Myssenger."<br/><br/><ii/>This app has a feature where you can send a message to your own profile, it may seem like a weird addition, but it is surprisingly useful. People often send themselves messages, notes, files, anything to remind themselves later, or simply just to store it for future access. Ironically, my case is the actually weird one here.<br/><ii/>"Enough rambling to myself, what should I send now?"<br/><ii/>I don't know how many times I need to tell my own self to calm down, but it's really uncomfortable for me right now. Working up the nerve sure is hard huh? Alright, maybe a hello should be enough.</pb>

  <div class="whitespace whitebox">
    <pb style="margin-bottom:2%; margin-top:2%"><ii/>"..."<br/><ii/>No surprise, it wouldn't make sense for me to get a reply instantly, or any at all. My personality needs to switch for <pg2>him</pg2> to even get the chance to reply. Even then, it's not guaranteed that <pg2>he'd</pg2> do that. I still have a hunch that he is trying to avoid me at all cost, the possibility of me getting a message back is abysmal.<br/><br/><ii/>"Well, that's that then."<br/><ii/>Having no plans for today, I decided to text one of my buddies, Ioka, to hang out with me. Ioka is a chubby guy who is also fairly short compared to the average Joe. He's a bit timid and indecisive, generally doesn't stand out much. Perhaps that's why I like him so much, he's someone that I am sure will rely on me. Considering how much of a loser I am, it's really nice to know I can still be useful to society.</pb>

  </chatl><br/>
    <div class="whitespace whitebox">
      <pb style="margin-bottom:2%; margin-top:2%"><ii/>Oh wow, he'll give me a ride too eh? To be fair I did say I was going to pay for his meals anyway. An eye for an eye type of thing I suppose. While waiting for Ioka, I decided to kill time playing Raid Royale, a real-time strategy game where you build decks and battle other people. It used to be much more popular a few years ago, there aren't many like me who continue to enjoy the game on a daily basis.<br/><br/><ii/>"..."<br/><ii/><i>It still worries me.</i><br/><ii/>"..."<br/><br/><ii/>The doorbell rings, snapping me out of my empty thoughts. How long have I been standing here? That doesn't matter, I'll go see Ioka now.<br/><br/><ii/>I rushed down the stairs and opened the front door.<br/><ii/><pi2>"Yo bud! Ready to go pick up your wife?"</pi2><br/><ii/>"Did you really have to rub it in the face like that? I don't think of figures as real people dude." I said, painfully.<br/><ii/><pi2>"Right, right. Whatever you say Toone. Okay, hop on."</pi2> He makes a gesture with his right arm, telling me to get in the car.<br/><ii/>Hopping in I did, I sat shotgun, my favorite seat. Somewhen during the ride, we had a lengthy chat about how 50 kangaroos could beat 50 lions. I am not sure how the conversation got there, but it was quite entertaining. Soon enough, we stopped at the Japanese store to pick up my Miju figurine. It's rather embarrassing to be known as the guy with these otaku hobbies, I frankly don't like to be called with that title but if it's true, then it's true. I live with the idea that anything you do in this world always comes with consequences and responsibilities. Avoiding them is a scummy move, to be a better person is to accept and face it. I believe that's how one gains trust and reputation, this is the rule that I always strive to abide by.<br/><br/><ii/><pi2>"I can treat myself to anything I want right? Nothing is off limits?"</pi2><br/><ii/>"On theory sure, but if you want to be an upstanding citizen of the community, you need to discipline your own appetite buddy."<br/><ii/><pi2>"Of course, of course. I was just kidding man, you don't need to prepare a lecture for me, Jesus."</pi2><br/><ii/>And so he says, even if he were to hold himself I doubt it would still be cheap. A light meal for him is a whole day's worth of food for me. I took my phone out to check my bank account balance.<br/><ii/>"..." My body begins to twitch.<br/><ii/>The phone was last left on the Myssenger app, but how could that be..? Looking at the bottom of the screen I see:</pb></div><br/>

Frantically, I tried to figure out what to do, sure, I told myself it'll all be okay before doing all of this. But getting an actual response? That is insane, I had a glimpse of hope that maybe it was just a wrong diagnosis or there was a mistake. This response had proven my disorder and there is no way around it. It is the truth.<br/><br/><ii/>Having calmed down myself a little more, I typed out the following:</pb></div><br/>

        <div class="whitespace whitebox">
          <pb style="margin-bottom:2%; margin-top:2%"><ii/>I felt a small relief after sending the messages. The strong feeling of dread and curiosity, however, still lingers within me.<br/><pi2><ii/>"Yo, we're at John Honsons."<br/></pi2><ii/>"Oh wow, you actually picked a cheap place, how very nice of you dude."<br/><pi2><ii/>"Well duh, if I drained the entirety of your wallet, there wouldn't be a next time for me right?"<br/></pi2><ii/>Oh. So that's why.<br/><br/><ii/>John Honsons, a coffeehouse chain that is practically everywhere here in Canada. They're practically the McDavids of coffees, not amazing, but not horrible either. They serve 'em cheap and serve 'em quick. Heading inside, I sat at the corner of the restaurant, Ioka went and made an order. I don't feel like eating right now.<br/><br/><ii/>I took my phone out again, <pg2>his</pg2> message was still there. It couldn't have been my mind playing tricks on me, I am sure of it now. But when did the message get here, when did my consciousness switch? More questions keep pouring into me.<br/><br/><ii/><pi2>"Here ya go Toone, a cup of coffee."</pi2> Ioka handed me a cup of coffee.<br/><ii/>"I don't remember asking you to spend my money on things that I don't need. But, but, I'll make an exception for this one." I then thanked him and took a sip. It's bitter, but it's good.<br/><ii/>Ioka sat down across from me, he pulled out his phone and started watching VikVok. Ioka is a good friend, he really knows how to read the room. He knows when to give me space and when to talk to me. He's a good listener, and he's a good talker. He's a good friend.<br/><br/><ii/>"..."<br/><ii/>I started looking for clues to <pg2>his</pg2> behavior. Checking the timestamp of the message, it was at 1:15 this afternoon. I believe I was playing Raid Royale at that time, could a switch have happened then?<br/><ii/>Ioka looked up from his phone.<br/><ii/><pi2>"What's wrong Toone? Ya look like yah've seen a ghost."</pi2><br/><ii/>"Ah, it's nothing. I just remembered I forgot to do something."<br/><ii/>"I think we should head home."<br/><ii/><pi2>"What? We've only been here for like what 10 minutes?"</pi2><br/><ii/>"I know, I just have something really important on my mind alright."<br/><ii/><pi2>"I'm not going to drive ya home dude."</pi2></br><ii/>"Then I'll just call a Yuber, cya."<br/><br/><ii/>The more I think about that message, the more paranoid I get. Something about it just feels wrong, nonetheless, it's too late now. I have to get to the bottom of it, I begin to walk out of the restaurant taking my phone out to call a Yuber home. An unpleasant smell suddenly appeared out of nowhere, and just as I turned around, a scream could be heard.<br/><ii/><pg2>"AAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH"</pg2><br/><ii/>"IOKA!" I yelled at the top of my lungs.<br/><ii/>Wasting no time, I immediately ran to him. He's vomiting, his eyes are bloodshot. What had happened? What is going on?<br/><br/><ii/>"Ioka, Ioka! What's wrong? What's happening?" I asked, panicking.<br/><ii/><pg2>"I-I don't know, I just suddenly felt really sick. Oh God, help me."</pg2> He said, his voice trembling full of stomach acid.<br/><ii/>"Someone call the ambulance! Please!" I begged.<br/><ii/>His face is turning pale, I turned to his arm and saw slashes. How did he get these? Blood abrubtly spews everywhere, his intenstines are coming out of his mouth. Ioka is dying, Ioka is dying.<br/><br/><ii/>"IOKA!" I screamed.<br/><ii/>"IOKA! IOKA!" I screamed, tears streamed down my face.<br/><ii/>"IOKA! IOKA! IOKA!" I screamed, tears streamed down my face, my voice fainted.<br/><br/>

It knows exactly what type of person you are and what kind of content you want to see. Ya know, I've always wanted to have the ability to read people.

I shook his lying body.</pg2><br/><ii/>I put my fingers below his nose, checking whether he's still breathing or not.<br/><ii/>"Still breathing." I sighed with relief.<br/><ii/>"Good thing ya paid for the meal, We'll get moving quick." As I drag his body to the car.<br/><br/><ii/>Staying inside much longer would cause a scene as wild as a rodeo, I sure am glad the place was hella empty.
